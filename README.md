# Redpill

I'm imagining a malware that is adaptable to it's environment. It is used to subvert the kernel and doing dynamic assessments based on a machine learning algorithm.
For example the Stuxnet virus sends it's traffic to a command-and-control that is static, which if it scans the internet and based on the data it obtains, trains itself and
spawn it's own control-and-command server.

## Design

- Rootkit (Windows, OS X, Linux)
- Kernel loadable module that runs it's own machine learning algorithm
